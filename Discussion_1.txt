In your own words, what is recursion?
*Functions call themselves,

Why is it necessary to have a base case?

*Recursive functions are recurrent, and if you don't set up some kind of limitor 
to act as brakes they will reccur indefinitely. Enter a base case: an instance 
of the recurrance that we are expecting, and can set as a switch to end the 
recurrance.


Graphs

What is a graph?
*Minimally; a set of nodes. Maximally, a set of nodes linked by edges which can 
(but don't have to) be directional, and can create cycles. Any number of nodes 
can have any number of parents.

How is a graph different from a tree?
*Trees are directional, acyclical, and each node is limited to having one parent.

Give an example of something that would be good to model with a graph.
*Social networks.
